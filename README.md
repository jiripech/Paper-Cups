# What the hell is this?

This repo contains the assignemnts I was working on during the 3 days of 4 day free course I took to evaluate it's meaningfulness. I chose Gitlab as a way of submitting solutions in that course because some students were barely able to understand what was being asked of them, but were having trouble creating it, so when I wanted to demonstrate something, this seemed like the best way to show it somewhere.

## Was it worth the time?

**Short answer:** Maybe if the the length of the course was not 4 days, but one day.

**Expansion:** Since I had no need to take any other course from the CodersLab, you can say it was not worth the time. Because the other students were absolute beginners, it was hard for me to get used to the snail's pace of the explanations and the questions that seemed long ago answered. Also, the teacher wasn't exactly well prepared, so I felt quite sorry for him at times.
